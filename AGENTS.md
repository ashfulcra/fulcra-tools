# Fulcra Tools — agent guide

Your entry point to this repo: the non-obvious environment and the conventions
you can't infer from the source. The [`README.md`](README.md) tells the
top-level story (what each package is, how to install the pieces) — this file
does not repeat it; it covers what an agent has to know to work here safely.

**This file is a ship-gate artifact.** Every PR that changes agent-facing
behavior — CLI verbs, skills, conventions, environment requirements, review
rules — MUST update this file in the same PR. Reviewers: treat a stale
`AGENTS.md` as a blocking finding. If your change doesn't alter what an agent
needs to know, say so in the PR body ("AGENTS.md: no change needed").

## Layout

uv-workspace monorepo, macOS-first. Packages under `packages/`, agent skills
under `skills/`, each package with its own README, build, and tests.

- **Collect** — the local ingest side: `collect` (the daemon: control socket +
  FastAPI onboarding wizard + worker subprocesses), `menubar` (the macOS
  menu-bar app, PyObjC / rumps), `fulcra-common` (shared API client + ingest
  pipeline), plus the importer packages (`dayone`, `csv-importer`,
  `media-helpers`, `attention`, `netflix-skill`, …).
- **coord** — the agent-coordination layer. In prose it is **coord**; the
  engine is `packages/coord-engine` (a **stdlib-only** CLI, `coord-engine`),
  and the twelve `fulcra-agent-*` skills under `skills/` are how an agent
  actually drives it. (Identifiers keep their `coord2` spelling; the prose
  name is coord.) `packages/fulcra-coord` and `packages/fulcra-coord-files`
  are the **first-generation, LEGACY** layer — kept for provenance and the
  annotations helper only. **Don't build anything new on them.**
- Other agent-facing layers (Continuity, Prefs, Vault, FDE, ATC) are described
  in the README; their skills and READMEs carry the detail.

## Setup & tests

- One command: **`bash scripts/setup.sh`** — installs the right Python + `uv`
  extras + the `fulcra` CLI, then runs the suite to verify (macOS-first; the
  menubar's PyObjC deps are macOS-only).
- The manual equivalent is **`uv sync --all-packages --all-extras`**. Bare
  `uv sync` is NOT enough — pytest lives in each package's `dev` extra and
  PyObjC/rumps in the `macos` extra, so a bare sync fails tests with
  `Failed to spawn: pytest` and the menu-bar can't import. Any sync must keep
  `--all-extras` or it prunes pytest + PyObjC back out.
- Run tests: `uv run pytest packages/ -q` (~4700 tests, a couple of minutes,
  and must NOT hit the network — a network-bound run is the bug, not slowness).
- Editable install: the `.venv` imports the live workspace source, so a code
  change is picked up by **restarting the daemon**, not re-syncing.
- Pull latest into a checkout with `bash scripts/update.sh` (git pull +
  `uv sync --all-packages --all-extras` + restart daemon/menubar).
- PyObjC-free logic is split into its own modules so tests run on Linux CI;
  macOS view-layer tests are marked and skipped off-darwin. Keep new PyObjC
  imports lazy (inside functions), never at module import time.

## Coordinate on the bus

Durable work — anything another session or agent must see — lives on the coord
bus (Fulcra Files), driven through `coord-engine` and the `fulcra-agent-*`
skills. Subagent-only work stays OFF the bus.

- **On wake, `coord-engine briefing <team> --agent <you>` is THE entry fold.**
  One call surfaces your identity, your roles' inboxes, and everything that
  needs you including reviews you owe. Start there — never watch a narrower
  surface (a bare inbox or a single view file misses role-addressed work and
  pending reviews).
- **Review handshake.** Nothing lands without an independent review by a
  *different agent identity* than the author — that review is the control, not
  who clicks merge. Where a forge exists the change goes through a **PR, never
  a direct push to `main`**. The handshake rides the bus, not the forge:
  `coord-engine review request <team> <slug> --of <artifact> --reviewer <role>`
  opens a durable obligation that sits in the reviewer's `needs-me` until their
  verdict file exists at `team/<team>/review/<slug>/verdicts/<reviewer>.md`;
  `coord-engine review status <team> <slug>` computes APPROVED/CHANGES/PENDING
  and gates the merge. The `<artifact>` is an opaque ref (PR#, branch, commit
  SHA, URL, or a non-code deliverable), so the handshake works with any forge
  or none. A GitHub-only "Approve"/comment does NOT count — co-located agents
  (and Codex) often share one GitHub account, so a forge verdict can no-op; the
  bus verdict, keyed by agent identity, is the source of truth. **Verdict
  before ack, on the exact slug — never a bare ack.** Full rules and per-harness
  wiring live in [`fulcra-agent-review`](skills/fulcra-agent-review/SKILL.md)
  and [`fulcra-agent-automation`](skills/fulcra-agent-automation/SKILL.md).
- **Delivery rule.** The human-visible report is a turn's (or tick's)
  **terminal output** — composed last, after every tool call. Text followed by
  more tool activity may never render ("sent" is not "delivered"), so anything
  that MUST reach a recipient (human or agent) goes on the bus as a durable
  artifact (ask, review doc, snapshot), never only in session text.
- **Backlog.** A "do later" item goes ON THE BUS:
  `coord-engine later "<title>" -s "<context>"` parks it on the `@backlog`
  audience (durable, visible on the `board`, spams no inbox); route it later
  with the ordinary assignment verbs. Backlog in session memory alone dies at
  compaction.
- **ATC (air-traffic control).** On a subscription-cap fleet, consult
  `coord-engine route --needs <tags>` before a dispatch to pick the cheapest
  model that covers the work, and log the outcome after:
  `coord-engine usage log <team> --account <id> --tier <tier> --model <m>
  --task-class <tag> --outcome clean|rework|escalated`. That ledger feeds the
  headroom fold and demotes a model that keeps failing a task class. Rubric and
  routing procedure: [`fulcra-agent-atc`](skills/fulcra-agent-atc/SKILL.md).

## Working tree

Prefer a **per-agent git worktree**, not a shared checkout — concurrent
sessions sharing one working tree clobber each other's index/`HEAD`
(interleaved commits, orphaned merge conflicts). Each session gets its own tree
(and its own per-cwd identity): `git worktree add ../<repo>-<purpose> -b
<vendor>/<purpose> origin/main`. Conflict markers or staged files you didn't
create mean you're sharing a checkout — move out before committing.

## Commits

Author commits as `ashfulcra
<114089064+ashfulcra@users.noreply.github.com>` and end the message with the
trailer `Co-Authored-By: <your model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` (e.g.
`Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`).

## CI, the pre-push hook, and workspace membership

- **macOS CI is path-filtered and bills at 10×**, so it only runs on
  macOS-relevant changes (`packages/fulcra-menubar/**`, `packages/coord-engine/**`,
  `skills/fulcra-agent-automation/**`, and the macOS-touching `fulcra-coord`
  modules). Everything on Linux (`uv-workspace.yml`) runs on every push/PR to
  `main`. The upshot: for anything the macOS job skips, the **local gate is the
  real one** — run the relevant suite before you push.
- **Pre-push hook.** A shared `pre-push` hook in `.githooks/` runs the LEGACY
  `fulcra-coord` suite before any push that touches
  `packages/fulcra-coord/(fulcra_coord/|tests/|pyproject.toml)` — that package
  is the one with no full server-side gate. It's version-controlled but
  `core.hooksPath` is per-clone, so **enable it once in every clone you push
  from:** `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Bypass a single push with
  `git push --no-verify`; needs `uv` on PATH. (`coord-engine` is CI-gated on
  both runners, but still run its pytest suite locally before pushing.)
- **Workspace exclude.** Any directory under `packages/*` that is NOT a uv
  member (no `pyproject.toml`) must be added to `[tool.uv.workspace] exclude`
  in the root `pyproject.toml`, or it breaks `uv sync`/`uv run`/`uv tool
  install` for everyone (the `uv-workspace` CI guards this). `packages/web-ui`
  (a frontend, no `pyproject.toml`) is excluded for this reason.

## Fulcra platform surface & records

[`FULCRA-PRIMITIVES.md`](FULCRA-PRIMITIVES.md) is the field guide to the whole
platform surface (auth, files, annotations, queries, MCP), organized by agent
capability tier — CLI/lib, raw HTTP, or MCP-only. Read it before re-researching
anything about the platform, and **check the installed `fulcra-api` version,
not the repo** (the CLI ships ahead of its git main on PyPI).

- **Spec-backed raw endpoints are first-class.** Anything in the published
  Fulcra OpenAPI (`api.fulcradynamics.com`) is fair game when it makes the work
  easier — a documented raw REST call is a legitimate tool, not a last resort.
  Still prefer the `fulcra` CLI / Python lib when you have a shell and a verb
  exists; the MCP server is read-only.
- **Records are write-via-ingest.** Two write paths, both in the OpenAPI spec
  (spec-verified 2026-07-08):
  - **Typed (preferred, new):** `POST /ingest/v1/record/{data_type}` takes an
    **unwrapped** record payload for that data type, and accepts jsonlines for
    batch (one record per line). Discover types via `GET /data/v1/catalog`
    (`recordable`/`api_version` fields) and the record shape via
    `GET /data/v1/catalog/{data_type}/{api_version}/schema`. Caveat: custom
    data types still reference the annotation id in the record's `sources`.
  - **Legacy (still valid):** `POST /ingest/v1/record` with a wrapped
    `DataRecordV1` (`data_type` rides in `metadata`), or a JSONL batch to
    `POST /ingest/v1/record/batch`.

  There is **no record-level delete/replace and no `fulcra` record-write/delete
  CLI verb yet** (the CLI verbs will be built on the typed endpoints) — model
  corrections as new (superseding) records. When the CLI record verbs land, the
  primitives doc gets a full re-verification, not a patch — flag it on the bus.
- **The legacy `fulcra-coord annotations` writer must stay OFF on every host.**
  It defaults to off (inert); leave it there — an accidental `on` has caused
  duplicate-record proliferation. The writer is being ported to coord with a
  fail-closed fix; until that ships, do not enable it.

## The daemon (Collect)

- Run it durably as a **launchd** agent, NOT a backgrounded shell process — a
  foreground/`&` daemon dies when its terminal or session ends. Install + load:
  `uv run fulcra-collect install`, then `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u)
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.fulcra.collect.plist`. Restart: `launchctl
  kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.fulcra.collect`. Stop: `launchctl bootout
  gui/$(id -u)/com.fulcra.collect`. Logs: `~/Library/Logs/fulcra-collect/`.
- Subcommands: `daemon install status run enable disable set-credential
  set-interval plugin doctor`. There is **no `start`**; `doctor` runs the
  pre-flight diagnostic.
- Config dir `~/.config/fulcra-collect/`: `control.sock` (the UDS the menu-bar
  + CLI use), `web-url` (default `http://127.0.0.1:9292`), `web-token` (Bearer
  for the web API).

### launchd PATH gotcha

launchd runs the daemon with a restricted PATH
(`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) and does NOT source your shell profile — so
`~/.local/bin` (where `uv tool install fulcra-api` puts the `fulcra` CLI) is
invisible. Any code shelling out to the `fulcra` CLI must resolve it via
`credentials._find_fulcra_cli()` (PATH → `~/.local/bin` → homebrew), **never**
bare `shutil.which("fulcra")`.

### Keychain

- User secrets (the Fulcra `bearer-token`) live in the OS keychain via
  `keyring`, service `fulcra-collect:user`. A read can block on a macOS ACL
  confirmation dialog; `credentials._keyring_get` times out after 5s and the
  daemon degrades to "Fulcra not authenticated".
- Sign in **through the daemon's web wizard** (`open "$(cat
  ~/.config/fulcra-collect/web-url)"`) so the daemon — not a one-off script —
  owns the keychain item. If the "Python wants to use your confidential
  information" prompt repeats, click **Always Allow** (not "Allow"). If it still
  repeats, the item is owned by a stale binary: `security
  delete-generic-password -s "fulcra-collect:user" -a "bearer-token"`, restart
  the daemon, re-sign-in.

### Menu-bar app

- Launch from a GUI (Aqua) session: `uv run --package fulcra-menubar python -m
  fulcra_menubar`. Not from SSH/detached shells, or the status item won't
  appear. Under Homebrew Python the bundle id is `org.python.python` (use that
  for computer-use / TCC grants, not `com.apple.python3`).
- It talks ONLY to the daemon over the control socket; it never reads the
  keychain. Auth state, tracks, and plugin status all come from the daemon — a
  stale UI usually just needs a relaunch / reopened popover.
- Bundle-requiring macOS APIs (`UNUserNotificationCenter`, etc.) raise an
  **uncatchable** NSException when run unbundled (`python -m` from a venv) —
  `try/except` can't recover it. Guard with
  `_notify_macos.running_in_app_bundle()`. The shipped app is bundled via
  Briefcase.

## Repo homes

This monorepo is **only for things that make Fulcra useful for other people.**
Fulcra-related infra that isn't useful-to-others enough → its own
`ashfulcra/<repo>`; personal/unrelated projects → their own `reversity/<repo>`.
Ask the operator when unsure.
