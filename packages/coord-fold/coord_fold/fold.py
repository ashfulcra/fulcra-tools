"""One pass: read forward from the cursor, apply, re-read, persist, report (spec §3.3). O(new events).

Ruling 1 (G26): the cursor is the recorded_at of the LAST APPLIED event, never now.
Ruling 2 (G27): re-read before write; a moved generation is refused BY NAME, never overwritten.
Ruling 4 (G25): hitting max_events is a remainder (rc 0); zero progress with events present is the only error.
G31 (codex-coder r7): the cursor PASSES observed-irrelevant records; a gap is an unapplied RELEVANT event.
