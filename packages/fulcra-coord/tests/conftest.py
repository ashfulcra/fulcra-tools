"""Hermetic test environment for fulcra-coord.

WHY THIS EXISTS — a real incident, not a nicety:

``cache.cache_root()`` resolves to ``${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/fulcra-coord``.
So any test that exercises a cache-writing code path (``write_cached_task``,
``_write_task_and_views``, ``cmd_reconcile``, ``_sweep_review_routes`` …)
WITHOUT first redirecting ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` writes straight into the
*operator's real* ``~/.cache/fulcra-coord``. Most test classes set
``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` by hand in ``setUp`` — but several did not (e.g. the
reviewer-routing sweep tests), and their fixtures (``author:h:r``,
``dead:h:r``, a title-less ``TASK-20260604-rev-00000000``) leaked into the
real cache. ``reconcile`` then read that polluted local cache and PUSHED the
junk tasks to the live remote coordination bus, where they crashed reconcile.
A prior run left 127 stray tasks in a developer's real ``~/.cache`` the same
way.

The fix is to make the cache hermetic BY DEFAULT for every test, so isolation
no longer depends on each test remembering to do it. This autouse fixture
points ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` at a fresh per-test temp dir and restores the prior
value afterward. Per-test (function) scope — not session — so tests never
share cache state, matching the per-test isolation the careful tests already
did manually (their in-``setUp`` ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` assignment still wins,
since it runs inside this fixture's redirected world and is harmless).

It also defaults ``FULCRA_COORD_BACKEND`` to ``false`` when unset, so a test
that reaches an unmocked remote file-op can never shell out to the real
``fulcra`` CLI and touch the live account — it hits the no-op ``false`` binary
instead. Tests that inject their own backend (the stateful fake, or an
explicit ``backend=`` argument) override this freely.

NOTE on scope mechanics: the suite is written with ``unittest.TestCase``
classes run under pytest. pytest applies ``autouse`` fixtures around unittest
tests, but it will NOT inject the ``tmp_path`` / ``monkeypatch`` fixtures into
unittest methods. So this fixture manages the temp dir and env vars by hand
(``tempfile`` + ``os.environ``) rather than requesting those fixtures — that
keeps it working for the existing unittest classes AND any future
pytest-style tests.

    # mode ``http``, obtained a real bearer token, and POSTed fixture titles

    # operator's LIVE Agent-Tasks timeline — the very surface their
    # situational-awareness reports read from. The pre-push hook runs the whole
    # suite, so every fulcra-coord push re-polluted it. Defaulting the env to
    # ``off`` here (env wins over the persisted file) makes the live path
