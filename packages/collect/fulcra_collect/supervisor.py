"""Service supervision — the restart decision for a service plugin whose
worker subprocess has exited.

The decision is pure: given the timestamps of recent exits within a
window, decide whether to restart (and after what backoff) or to declare
a crash loop and stop. The daemon owns the actual subprocesses and the
sleeping; this module owns only the policy.
